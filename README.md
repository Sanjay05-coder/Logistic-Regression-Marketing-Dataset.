Logistic Regression ‚Äì Marketing Campaign Prediction
üìå Project Overview

This project applies Logistic Regression to predict customer responses in a marketing dataset. The aim is to classify whether a customer will respond positively (e.g., accept a campaign offer) based on demographic and behavioral features.

The results show that Logistic Regression performs reasonably well on this dataset:

Confusion Matrix: Only one misclassification observed.

Accuracy: ~ 0.75 (75%), which indicates a good but not perfect model.


üîç Analysis Performed

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generated a heatmap to examine feature correlations.

Observed weak-to-moderate correlations with the target variable.

Model Training (Logistic Regression):

Dataset split into training and test sets.

Logistic Regression classifier trained on customer features.

Model Evaluation:

Confusion matrix used to analyze classification outcomes.

Metrics calculated: Accuracy.

üìä Results

Confusion Matrix:

Only 1 misclassification observed on the test set.

Model Accuracy:

75% (0.75) overall accuracy.

Logistic Regression generalizes fairly well but may benefit from feature engineering or more complex models.
